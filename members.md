* Andrew MacDonald is a Postdoctoral researcher at the Universit√© de Montreal. Formerly a tropical field ecologist, now reinventing himself as a "computational ecologist". Interests include entomology, bayesian statistics and human languages.
* Nicholas Marino is a Postdoctoral researcher at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. I have a broad interest in several fields from community and ecosystem ecology, and how could we use food web theory to link these two scales; I also enjoy statistics, and have great fun with it.
* Paula Omena is a Postctoral researcher at Universidade Estadual de Campinas. I am an ecologist with broad interest in community and ecosystem ecology, with special interest in predator-prey interactions. Moreover, I really like behavioral ecology :-) 
* Diane Srivastava is a community ecologist interested in all things spatial, trophic and functional. Diane enjoys making null models, drinking caipirinhas and long walks in the rainforest.
* Colette Ward is a postdoctoral researcher at Fisheries and Oceans Canada. She is a community ecologist with a soft spot for aquatic food webs. She enjoys working and playing in her study systems and learning how to better wrangle large datasets.
